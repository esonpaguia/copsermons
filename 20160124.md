## Teaching

### Influences
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [2 Cor 11:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/11-3.html)
- we have to deal with the influences that comes against our lives
- when our minds get astray, you change, your relationship with God changes
- when people can change the way you think, it changes your thoughts, decisions, future & relationships
- [Pro 4:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/4-23.html)
- don't allow outside influences to control how you think. We renew our minds according to the WOG
- think like the bible
- pastors are assigned to an area of influence (biblical pastoral influences), specific group of people
- pastors' influence increases as your faith increases
- It's has nothing to do with the pastor's eloquence, intellect or charisma
- when our faith grows, pastor's ability to influence grows
- the pastor's job is to build you up spiritually and follow Jesus

#### The battle field of the human mind
- every temptation begins as a thought
- [1 Chr 21:1](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/21-1.html)
- temptation doesn't enter thru your fingernail, sinuses, mouth, eyeballs. It starts as a thought
- [2 Cor 11:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/11-3.html)
- having a bad thought is not a sin, it is only a temptation
- we don't meditate on those stupid thoughts, but dismiss them
- [1 Pet 1:13-15](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/passage/?q=1-peter+1:13-15) - prepare your mind for action
- don't allow your mind just to vegitate, wonder or be idle
- God gave us a brain
- you should have a moving mind

#### Strongholds of the mind
- [2 Cor 10:4-7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/passage/?q=2-corinthians+10:4-7)
- demons are not strongholds
- Jesus said *"It is finished at the cross"*
- Jesus disarmed the demons. They don't have any strongholds. They are defeated, Jesus is Lord

#### What is a stronghold?
- the strongholds are the intellectual system of logics in our minds
- [2 Cor 10:4-7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/passage/?q=2-corinthians+10:4-7)
- the pastor's job is to demolish the system of logics of people that keep them from the knowledge of God
- those logics becomes a stronghold which in turn affects your decisions and lifestyle
- listen how you talk and think to determine if you have a stronghold
- [2 Cor 10:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/10-7.html) 
- you live on the surface, slogan and cliches

#### Negative influences that we must keep away from our Christian mind
- [Gal 5:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/5-8.html) - negative influences are influences that don't come from God
- [James 1:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/james/1-7.html)
- when preachers try to engage the culture and tells you to participate on things that the bible says are wrong and they say **"It's okay"**, it's a false religion
- they tell you to pollute yourselves
- when people begin to influence you on things you know are wrong, you got to recognize
- if it pollutes you with this world, it is false religion

##### Strongholds
  1. Wine
    - [Isa 28:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/28-7.html) - drunken preachers
    - no scriptures in the bible that doesn't go against beer/hard liqiour
    - the wine 2000 years ago is not the same wine we know today
    - the room  was prepared for the last supper
    - that room had to be cleared from all yeast
    - part of the passover celebration is no yeast is allowed
    - when there is no yeast, there would be no alcohol
    - so why people drink?
    - alcohol is a poison. Your body counteracts it
    - [Daniel 5:2](http://www.biblestudytools.com/daniel/5-2.html) - alcohol influences your thinking
    - alcohol is called social lubricant, to influence/persuade people
  2. Bad company
    - [1 Cor 15:33](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/15-33.html)
    - friends can change us
    - it doesn't change you immediately, but corrupts you slowly
  3. False religion
    - [Acts 19:27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/19-27.html)
    - don't learn errors but truths
    - when you open up to other teachings, it will corrupt you
  4. Bad examples
    - [3 Joh 8-11](http://www.biblestudytools.com/3-john/passage/?q=3-john+1:8-11)
    - don't allow bad examples to influence you, follow what is good
    - if you try look for a bad example, you will always find one
    - don't look for an excuse to rationalize your decision
  5. Evil wife
    - [1 Kings 21:25](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/21-25.html) - Jezebel made Ahab to sold himselft to the devil
    - [1 Kings 11:3-4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/passage/?q=1-kings+11:3-4) - God can't choose an heir for Solomon because he has no Jewish son
    - his wives turned his heart away from God
    - marry somebody who loves Jesus more than you do
    
#### When we get influenced, we change
- [1 King 11:3-4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-kings/passage/?q=1-kings+11:3-4) - they change Solomon's heart towards God
- your heart includes your desires, attitudes, emotions, thoughts
- when you begin to have other desires, attitudes, emotions and thoughts, there is an evil influence in your life
- when your heart begins to turn, it's time to change friends

#### We need a good Christian mental health
- [Rom 8:5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/8-5.html)
- [Col 3:2](http://www.biblestudytools.com/colossians/3-2.html)
- [Phi 4:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-8.html)
- think on things that are pure, lovely and of good report
