## Offering:

### When God says *"Well-done"*
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mat 25:14-30](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+25:14-30)

- opportunity is given based from our ability
- the first 2 servants were given leadership and responsibility (to be in-charge of many things) as reward
- the  were rewarded the same
- ability creates the opportunity, but reward is determined by faithfulness
- unproductive people are always bad attitude people
- bad attitude makes you unproductive
- When God says *"Well done"*, his reward is more work
- the path of promotion, leadership, invitiation in the presence of the Father in life, is all about *"well done"*

## Teaching:

### Fasting
by Sis. Beverly Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mic 6:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/6-8.html)

- God expects us:
  1. to act justly
  2. to love mercy
  3. to walk humbly with God
- Jesus told us we would fast
- fasting is good for us physically. Even the non-Christians fast to detoxt
- as Christians, we do fasting to humble ourselves before the Lord

#### What should we be doing when fasting?
[Jer 36:4-6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/jeremiah/passage/?q=jeremiah+36:4-6)

1. Go to the house of the Lord on the day of fasting
  - we should have a special Lord-and-me day with our God
2. To read from the Word of God
  - read a little more than normal
  - spend reading on the supposed meal time

#### What if you can't go to the house of God?
[Psa 119:164](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/119-164.html)

- 7 times a day David set time with the Lord
- read scripture, say a prayer, worship God
- it is much more just remembering God, but consciously setting time with the Lord

#### During fasting:
- We should not broacast it
  - it is not a social media event
- When you fast, it should not be obvious to others
  - not a moment of pride, but humility
- Fasting should be spent with God
- Fasting should be a time in the Word of God

#### Fasting is not just all about yourself, but also praying for one another.
