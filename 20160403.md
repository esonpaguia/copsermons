## Offering

### Generosity
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mk 14:1-9](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/passage/?q=mark+14:1-9)

- this was a very expensive, lavish gift but Jesus described it as she has done a beautiful thing to him ([Mk 14:6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/14-6.html))
- [Mt 26:10](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/26-10.html) - she did this not to please others, but she did it for Jesus
- [Mk 14:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/14-8.html) - she did what she could
- there's a lot of things she can do, but this is something that she could do
- generosity doesn't sit back and wish it could do something, but it does what it can do
- she had done this because she didn't consume it upon herself
- [Jn 12:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/12-7.html) - she saved it for Jesus' burial
- So why she can do something? She was not a consumer/user, she was a giver
- God gives us things that are not for us, seeds to sow


## Teaching

### Individual Relationship with Christ
by Ptr. Alisha Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Ps 5:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/5-3.html)

- we need a strong relationship/experience with God
- the key of a strong and permanent church growth is to be involved and doing what God is doing
- to some being holy and attending church on Sundays is their extent/limit of their relationship with God
- we need individual relationship with Christ

#### The foundation of a relationship
- it is important to have a strong foundation of relationship with God

##### What is a personal, strong and secured foundation and relationship with God?
- we have to know that we have the right to a personal relationship with God
- other people can't have it for us, but we have the right to have one for ourselves
- [Rm 5:2](http://biblestudytools.com/romans/5-2.html) - Jesus provided the access for us to the Father
- provided the opportunity for us: [Eph 2:18](http://biblestudytools.com/ephesians/2-18.html), [Eph 3:12](http://biblestudytools.com/ephesians/3-12.html), [Mt 27:51](http://biblestudytools.com/matthew/27-51.html)
- the Holy Spirit assists/helps us to our relationship with God because He is the one who creates in us the desire to have a relationship with God, desire to be close to Him: [Rm 8:15](http://biblestudytools.com/romans/8-15.html), [Ga 4:6](http://biblestudytools.com/galatians/4-6.html)
- [Eph 2:18](http://biblestudytools.com/ephesians/2-18.html) - the Holy Spirit helps to usher us to God's presence, be guided in the presenced of the Lord
- we need to realize that there is a difference between having the right to having a relationship and actually participating/being active in the relationship with God
- all of us have the right to have a relationship with God, but it doesn't mean we have an active relationship with Him 
- it is not enough to know that we can go to the Father, that we can pray, that we can have a relationship with God
- if we don't actively participate we will not see a relationship with God grow in our lives

##### Every relationship requires 2 things
1. initial investment of time to develop it
  - some people get saved and then that's it
  - after getting saved, we must take time to learn about God so that our relationship will grow
  - new believers need to be taught to do this
  - they have to work on and develop the relationship
2. continue to have time with God

##### Examples of daily devotions and regular prayer life
- it is not beneficial for anyone for a person to read his/her bible, that's between him/her and God. That is the time that God teaching him/her.
- Biblical examples: [Ps 5:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/5-3.html), [Ps 55:17](http://biblestudytools.com/psalms/55-17.html), [Lk 2:37](http://biblestudytools.com/luke/2-37.html), [1 Th 3:10](http://biblestudytools.com/1-thessalonians/3-10.html), [1 Ti 5:5](http://biblestudytools.com/1-timothy/5-5.html), [Da 6:10](http://biblestudytools.com/daniel/6-10.html)

#### How to spent time in prayer
1. prepare yourself before you pray
  - you might be distracted or having a bad day
  - unclutter your soul, settle your emotions, your mind must be clear
  - [Ps 131:1-2](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=psalm+131:1-2), [1 Pe 4:7](http://biblestudytools.com/1-peter/4-7.html)
  - if you are mad, upset, your emotions gets in your way
  - it makes you frustated and give up even you haven't started on reading your bible, or praying or worshipping
  - how to come your emotions:
    - try to read your bible, something that encouraging to you
    - try have time of praise and worhip
    - try to remember what God has accomplished in your life
2. organize your prayer
  - [Ps 5:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/5-3.html) - "lay" means to arrange in a specific pattern, not repeating over and over again
  - give some thought what are you talking to God about

##### What do we do in praying?
- Lord's prayer a great biblical pattern for us to follow


1. [Mt 6:9](http://biblestudytools.com/matthew/6-9.html) - we must address the Father
  - our prayer must have time that worships God 
  - a time of thanksgiving 
  - tell God who He is to you, what He has done for you
  
2. [Mt 6:10](http://biblestudytools.com/matthew/6-10.html) - bring our requests before God
  - what requests do we bring?
    - requests concerning God 
      - this is where God's authority to be established
    - requests concerning God's will to be done
      - know what the bible says, what God's promises are
    - requests concerning yourself
      - [Mt 6:11-13](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=matthew+6:11-13)
      - take time to pray that our needs will be taken care in advance
      - daily bread is given the night before, not the day it was needed
    - our forgiveness
      - we all sin regulary
      - as God forgives you, you in turn forgive people who have wronged you
      
3. [Mt 6:11-13](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=matthew+6:11-13) - temptation is going to come
  - even Jesus was tempted 
  - what matter is what do you do when temptation comes, do you feed that temptation, do you give in to that temptation or do you push that away 
  - what is your response to the temptation going to be, how will you reply/deal with it


- After talking to God, expect Him to answer, time to listen: [Ps 27:8](http://biblestudytools.com/psalms/27-8.html), [Gn 15:1](http://biblestudytools.com/genesis/15-1.html), [Gn 17:1](http://biblestudytools.com/genesis/17-1.html)
- expect to know what God desires for you
- how God answers back:
  - something in your heart that God is confirming while you are reading your bible or praying
    - God will not put something in your heart that agrees with the bible
    - God will not contradict Himself
  - God will speak to you thru your devotions
    - God uses His words to speak to you, to give you directions in your life
- make God a priority
