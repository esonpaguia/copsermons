### Make A Plan
by Ptr. Marlon Delos Reyes

#### Context verse: [Pr 16:1-4,9](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/passage/?q=proverbs+16:1-4)

- God expects man to take the initiative.
- God wants us to make some planning but note that God rules and reigns.
- Plan means placing things, setting things, laying everything in order.


1. Only God can make a plan work.
  - [Pr 16:1](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/16-1.html)
  - That is why we need to commit our plans to the Lord.
2. Man initiates a plan based on his personal ethics
  - [Pr 16:2](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/16-2.html)
  - We may think our plans are all right, but we need to make sure our conscience or morals are based on the Word of God.
  - Make sure we're doing it the right way.
  - The world may decided what is cool or politically right today, but make sure that only God determines what is right and what is wrong.
3. Man initiates plans but never to the exclusion of God
  - [Pr 16:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/16-3.html)
  - Commit means roll over.
  - When we commit/roll over these with God, we are saying may His will be done upon our lives.
  - It is when we put total trust in God, we will see success happening in our lives.
  - [2 Ch 32:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-chronicles/32-8.html)
  - [Is 40:31](http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/40-31.html)

## Teaching

### The Faithful
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Ac 21:8-17](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+21:8-17)

- The offerings are heavy, they are in silver and gold coins, no paper money.
- [Ac 21:15](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-15.html) - They prepare for the journey.
- This is the most dangerous part of the journey because Paul has enemies. 

#### A season of destiny
- Paul was attempting to heal the gap between Jew and Gentile churches.
- Paul was attempting to heal a church that was radically divided by doctrine and culture.
- Paul had all these Gentile churches take these great offering and bring it up to Jerusalem.
- This is a season which the Jews in the church in Jerusalem and all accross Israel were all have to make a decision of do they embrace salvation by faith/grace or do they stick with the culture.
- Would they embrace all Christians or demand them to conform to Judaism?
- This was a season of destiny.

#### In a season of destiny, put your trust to the faithful
- You do not entrust yourself to unproven people, you entrust yourself to faithful people.
  - When starting a new career, job, business or opportunity, it is easy not to look to old friends (faithful people) around you and embrace the new.  
  - [1 Sam 17:39](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-samuel/17-39.html) - You do not entrust yourself to new people or acquaintances.
- You do not put your trust on unreliable people.
  - [Pr 25:19](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/25-19.html) 
- If you put your trust on unproven or unreliable people, you will find yourself not focusing on your destiny but rather focusing on the pain these people are causing you.
- Your attention will be diverted from what God has spoken what you have to do, diverted off of the goal that God has placed in front of you. All that you will be thinking about is the pain these people brought into your life. 
- You have to learn who to trust.

#### Faith of the three men that Paul put trust to
- [Ac 21:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-8.html) - Philip

  - He prophesied for 25 years.
- [Ac 21:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-16.html) - Mnason 
  - He was one of the early disciples. 
  - Where Paul stays when in Jerusalem.
- These men served God for a long time, old timers.
