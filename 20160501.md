- there are temporary commands given to the disciples
- people of faith knew that God can raise the dead
- [He 11:35](http://biblestudytools.com/hebrews/11-35.html)
- we see this in scripture rare but not uncommon miracle
- we don't have any promises in scripture to raise the dead
- we have promises to lay hands to the sick and they shall recover 
- we know that God does raise the dead but we don't have any promises to stand on in faith 
- there are things that God can do that there are no promises about
- we know that God can raise the deade but we don't have any promises to raise the dead to stand upon
- [Jn 5:25-26](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+5:25-26)
- [Mt 27:52-53](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=matthew+27:52-53) - the cross was an explosion of life
- the power of death has been broken

#### Instances of raising the dead
- [1 Ki 17:17-24](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1+kings+17:17-24)
- [2 Ki 4:32-37](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2+kings+4:32-37)

- [Ac 20:20](http://biblestudytools.com/acts/20-20.html)    

#### What actually occurs when a person is raised from the dead?

##### What is life?
- only God can give life
- [Gen 2:7](http://biblestudytools.com/genesis/2-7.html) - we are created from dust and God breath into the man the breath of life and we become a living spirit
- we are created in the image of God 
- we are spirit beings, we have a soul and a body
- this body is a temporary dwelling place 

##### What is death?
- [Ps 104:29](http://biblestudytools.com/psalms/104-29.html) - death is God taking our breath away
- [Lk 23:46](http://biblestudytools.com/luke/23-46.html) - death is our spirit leaving our body 

##### Where do we go when we die?
- [1 Co 5:6-8](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1+corinthians+5:6-8)
- when we die, our spirit lives our body and immediately goes to God

##### What is raising the dead?
- the spirit has to come back to the body
- [Lk 8:55](http://biblestudytools.com/luke/8-55.html)
- life has to come back to the body
- [1 Ki 17:21-22](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1+kings+17:21-22)


- maybe one reason there is no promise is who wants to come back?
- how can you make them decide to return?
- only the Father can bring/return life to the body
- this is not something that is done by faith or by annointing 
- the apostles/we must learn that the Father can do this, but this is not a ministry or an annointing. This is something the Father does.

#### How do you raise the dead?

1. Paul didn't participate in the emotional outcry of the people
  - [Ac 20:10](http://biblestudytools.com/acts/20-10.html) - he focused on the ministry
  - emotions won't negate faith but they may interfere with faith 
    - [Jn 11:35-44](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+11:35-44) - Jesus' emotions didn't nullify His faith
  - emotional atmosphere may hinder/interfere with faith
    - [Lk 8:51-56](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+8:51-56)
    - [Ac 9:39-41](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+9:39-41)
    - it is hard to pray if there are screaming and crying all around you
2. Paul expressed no fear of physical contact with the dead
  - that time, they bury their dead the same day
  - [1 Ki 17:21](http://biblestudytools.com/1-kings/17-21.html)
  - [2 Ki 4:34-35](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2+kings+4:34-35)
  - part of ministering or praying to people for their life to return to them is that you are not afraid of death
  - you cannot fear death and minister to people
  
#### The condition of the body 
- nowhere in scripture, that a embalmed body is resurrected 
  - Egyptian started embalment
  - bodies, that were raised from the dead, were intact but prepared for burial
    - prepared but intact
      - [Ac 9:37](http://biblestudytools.com/acts/9-37.html)
      - [Jn 11:43-44](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+11:43-44)
    - the bodies maybe in different stage of decomposition
      - [Lk 7:14-15](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+7:14-15)
      - [Jn 11:39](http://biblestudytools.com/john/11-39.html) 
      - [Mt 27:52-53](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=matthew+27:52-53) - long time dead
- resurrection of the dead is not done for show or in public
  - it is done private or semi-private
    - private:
      - [1 Ki 17:17-24](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1+kings+17:17-24)
      - [2 Ki 4:32-33](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2+kings+4:32-33)
      - [Ac 9:39-40](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+9:39-40)
      - [Lk 8:50-51](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+8:50-51)
    - semi-private: 
      - [Ac 20:10](http://biblestudytools.com/acts/20-10.html)
      - [Lk 7:11-17](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+7:11-17)
    - there is no promises to stand on, but it is God who decides to do it

#### How do you raise the dead?
1. Pray to God
  - [1 King 17:20](http://biblestudytools.com/1-kings/17-20.html)
  - [Jn 11:41-42](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+11:41-42)
  - [Ac 9:40-41](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+9:40-41)
2. Give a command
  - [Lk 7:14-15](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+7:14-15)
  - [Lk 8:52-55](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+8:52-55)
  - [Ac 9:40-41](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+9:40-41)
  - [Jn 11:43-44](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+11:43-44)
  - there is no rebuking or yelling

- only the Father can put life back in them, can return the spirit

#### What does not work
- do not send your offering and get a prayer cloth
- the annointing/faith is not for sale 
- [2 Ki 4:29-31](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2+kings+4:29-31) - it is not about annointing or transferring of faith
- we always almost seeing an immediate result
- we don't beg God

#### What are the effects 
- [Ac 20:11-12](http://biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+20:11-12) - alive and well, not sick or in pain
- everything is healed
- Jesus when resurrected, He was healed from any scars, injury


- Paul preached another 5 hours after the boy was resurrected, because he wanted them to  remembered what he was preaching and not to focus on him resurrecting the dead
- kept their focus in the WOG but not in the miracle
