  - you don't wait to save a big amount

2. Little foxes spoil the vines
  - set a family budget

  - as a good steward, we should not be wasteful
  - waste is in the heart of the beholder
  - what wasteful to you, may not be wasteful/meaningless to other people

### Encounter with God
by Ptr. Joe Cruse

#### Context verse: [Exo 3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/3.html)
- things of God are holy
- Moses had an encounter with God

#### When you encounter God
1. there's always be a place where God will speak to you
2. there's always be a manifestation of God's power at that place
  - God will not come empty-handed
3. you have a choice
4. call of God
5. there will be a change
  - God doesn't just want to touch you, but He will change you

### How will you know that God changed you?
- [Exo 3:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/3-16.html) - "visited" means equipped
- Moses' face was gloving

- [Exo 19](http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/19.html)
