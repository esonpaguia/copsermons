by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Act 19:23-41](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+19:23-41)

- real salvation that changes lives matter
- society doesn't mind religion, but changed lives disturbs society
- [Act 11:26](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/11-26.html) - first time the believers were called Chrisitians at Antioch
- seen with same lifestyle
- the society recognized these people changed and are alike the annointed one
- [Act 24:5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-5.html) - they cannot accept that Jesus is the messiah
- they tagged Jesus as nazarrene thus they call the believers are from nazarrene sect

#### The Way
- [Act 24:14](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-14.html)
- [Act 28:22](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/28-22.html) - Christianity was called "The Way"
- [Act 19:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/19-23.html) - Paul also identified the believers as "The Way"
- [Act 18:25-26](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+18:25-26)
- [Act 24:22](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/24-22.html)
- [John 14:6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/14-6.html) - Jesus is The Way
- identified by the lifestyle that the believers live
- what we focus on (at heaven), who we follow (Jesus), where we headed (heaven)
- people who live with transparently change lives

#### The Discturbance
- the disturbance didn't arise because of the ministy of Paul, or any leaders
- [Act 19:36-37](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+19:36-37) - people of the way had done nothing wrong
- the temple of Artemis was known as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world
- everybody wanted to see the temple
- but Paul and the believers ignored it for the last 3.5 years and didn't do anyting against the temple of Artemis

##### Principle of leadership: We preach priniciples, we don't attack specifics
- [1 Cor 10:19-20](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/passage/?q=1-corinthians+10:19-20)
- [1 Cor 12:2](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-corinthians/12-2.html)
- Paul didn't feel the need to do spiritual war because man-made gods or demons are nothing
- Why focus on nothing? Nothing is nothing so do nothing
- you cannot change people by telling them how wrong they are, just talk about Jesus
- stay of message, pay attention to Jesus

#### Changed lives
- changed lives affected their income (to see/visit temple of Artemis)
- they had a problem with it
- it distubed the money flow of the society
