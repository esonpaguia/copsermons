## Teaching

### After your healing
by Ptra. Alisha Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Jn 9:1-41]()

#### Your healing will be attacked
- The blind man was persecuted after he was healed
- He was seen as a sinner and a bad person
- They do not believe that we serve God that can heal
- Religious people struggle in the reality of miracles
- Religion:
  - investigates/brings hostility to miracle
  - insults a person who has been healed - [Jn 9:34]() 
  - condemns a person who has been healed - [Jn 9:34]() 
  - treats a peron who has been healed with complete arrogance - [Jn 9:22]() 
    - [Jn 9:18]()
    - [Jn 9:25]() - When we receive a miracle we don't debate doctrine, we just state the fact
- Satan will attempt to steal your healing
- Healing can be stolen.

#### 4 steps to maintain your healing
1. We need to recognize the source of our healing
  - We need to accept that it's God's work in our lives.
  - Be humble enough to acknowledge that God healed you.
  - 3 type of faith to bring healing to our lives:
    1. God's faith
      - [Mk 3:1-6]()
      - [Lk 22:50-51]()
      - If you are not looking for healing or no understanding of God and His gift of healing, you will loose your healing.
    2. Another Christian's faith
      - [Mk 2:3-5]()
      - [Jn 4:46-50]()
      - [Mt 8:5-13]()
    3. Your own faith
      - [Mt 8:2-3]()
      - [Mt 9:20-22]()
  - [Ro 10:17]() -Source of faith comes from different things but to build your faith is to dig in to the Word of God.
2. We need to refuse fear the old sickness.
  - Fear removes God's protection from our lives.
  - [Jo 3:25]() - If you have fear, it is saying God is not bigger than your problem.
3. Strengthen your foundation about healing.
  - Build our lives upon the Word of God, not upon our knowlede, feelings or emotions.
  - [Mt 7:24-27]()
  - Lack of knowledge of God will keep you from keeping your healing.
  - Do not confuse of lack of stregth to lack of healing.
4. Remove and watch out for doubt.
  - Satan will plant doubts.
  - Instead of having faith, you are having doubt.

#### What to do after you got healed
1. Validate your healing with a doctor.
  - [Mt 8:1-4]()
  - [Mk 1:40-45]()
  - We need to be bold of what God has done for us.
  - Obey God's specific instructions when you got healed.
    - [Mk 1:40-2:1]()
    - [Mk 7:33-37]()
    - [Lk 5:12-14]()
2. Realize to stop sinning.
  - [Jn 5:7-18]()
  - Sin brings sickness.
  - Sometimes God points out some relationships that we need to remove or go away from.
    - [Mk 8:22-26]()
3. Never forget to come back and say thanks
  - [Lk 17:11-20]()
