## Offering

### Your harvest
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### God made promises to us
- [2 Co 9:10](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/9-10.html) - He gives us seed to sow
- [1 Ch 29:14](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-chronicles/29-14.html) - All we give comes from God

#### Faith for the harvest
- [Ga 6:7-9](http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/passage/?q=galatians+6:7-9)
- When you give to God, you are sowing a seed. When you sow a seed, there will be a harvest.
- Rewarding faithfulness
- [Jn 6:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/6-38.html)
- [Ph 4:15-16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/passage/?q=philippians+4:15-16) - giving and receiving are tied together
- [Ph 4:17](http://www.biblestudytools.com/philippians/4-17.html)
- God keeps a record of your seeds
- [Lk 6:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/6-38.html) - it is not based on the amount but generosity

## Teaching

### God's Harvest
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Jn 4:23-42](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/passage/?q=john+4:23-42)

- Samaritan revival

#### Choosing to see the harvest
- Open your eyes and look
- [Mt 9:37-38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+9:37-38)
- [Lk 10:2](http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/10-2.html)
- Seeing is a choice
- People close their eyes for things they don't want to see

##### Why do Christians close their eyes to the harvest?
- They've seen the false harvest - [Mt 13:36-39](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:36-39)
  - False and true Christians are looked identical except with their fruits
  - Don't pay attention to the bad stuffs, but to the harvest
  - We all get discouraged on the fake but the harvest is still out there
- We also get discouraged in terms of numbers
- They don't like the people of the harvest
  - Jews hate the Samaritans
  - They only want rich/clean people to come to the church
  - There's nobody good enough to go to God's house
- They are so busy/fouced on serving Jesus, but Jesus just wanted to focus on the harvest only
  - Open your eyes and look at the fields (harvest, unsaved), not to each other
  - Harvest is time-bound
  - It's all hands on deck, everyone will work when the harvest is ripe
  - The harvest won't stay there forever

#### Strength for the harvest
- [Jn 4:31-32](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/passage/?q=john+4:31-32) - You never burn out when doing God's will
  - You are strengthen doing the work of God
  - If you get burnt out, ask yourself if you are doing God's will
  - God's will energizes you
- [Co 1:29](http://www.biblestudytools.com/colossians/1-29.html) - God gives us energy
- [Lk 10:38-42](http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/passage/?q=luke+10:38-42) - If you feel worn out/no strength for the labor maybe because you are too elaborate.
  - Just do the simple thing, so that you have time to sit at Jesus
- [Mt 9:37-38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+9:37-38) - Many hands make light labor
