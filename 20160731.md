## Teaching

### Baptism
by Ptr. Marlon Delos Reyes

#### Context verse: [Mt 28:18-20](Jn 8:31-32)

#### 5 parts of the great commission
1. Go
  - not invite, gather people from other churches
2. Make disciples
  - [Jn 8:31-32](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+8:31-32)
  - we are Jesus' disciples, not disciples for somebody
3. Baptize
4. Teach
  - it is a lifetime commitment to teach them what Jesus has done
5. Promise of His presence
  - this is a promise from God
  - God is with us

#### Early Christian desire for water baptism
- early Christians take initiative to be water baptize
- [Ac 16:33](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/16-33.html) - the jailer and his family were baptized in the middle of the night
- [Ac 8:36, 38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+8:36;+acts+8:38)
- [Ac 16:14-15](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+16:14-15)
- they are drown spiritually
- [Ac 9:18](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/9-18.html) - Paul immediately got water baptized
- [Ac 10:46-48](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+10:46-48)

#### Why this early Christian desire is not strong today?
1. Baptism is not being preached in part of salvation
  - water baptism is part of the message
  - [Mk 1:4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-4.html)
  - [Lk 3:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/luke/3-3.html)
  - [Ac 2:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-38.html)
  - the message is "Repent and be baptized"
2. We don't want to offend people
3. Other people don't have the facility to do it

#### When do we do it?
1. To follow repentance
  - [Ac 2:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-38.html) - baptism is followed after repentance
  - repentance is a decision for change
  - a baby cannot make decision by him/herself
  - repentance is not a result of judgement, but hope
2. To follow confession of sin
  - [Mt 3:6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/3-6.html)
  - [Mk 1:5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/1-5.html)
  - baptism shows the aggreement between you and what God says
3. To follow belief
  - [Mk 16:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/16-16.html)
  - [Ac 8:12-13](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+8:12-13)
  - [Ac 18:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/18-8.html)
  - if you believe, you will have no problem obeying God
  - [Ac 2:41](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-41.html)
  - [Ac 8:12](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/8-12.html)
  - [Ac 19:5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/19-5.html)
  - acceptance of the message of Christ

#### Why should we be water baptize?
1. It identifies us with the death and ressurection of Jesus Christ
  - [Col 2:12](http://www.biblestudytools.com/colossians/2-12.html)
  - [Ro 6:3-4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=romans+6:3-4) - we are baptized thru Jesus' death
  - this is why baptism is immersion in the water, not sprinkling
  - we declare it, we do it publicly
2. It identifies us as disciples of Jesus
  - [Ac 2:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/2-38.html)
  - [Ac 8:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/8-16.html)
  - [1 Co 1:13-16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=1+corinthians+1:13-16) - we are baptized in the name of Jesus only
  - acceptance of Him and His message
  
#### What are the effects of water baptism in our spiritual lives?
1. It clothes us with Christ
  - [Ga 3:27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/galatians/3-27.html)
2. It brings a washing of conscience of sin
  - [Ac 22:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/22-16.html)
  - [1 Pe 3:21](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/3-21.html)
  - you have a new/changed life
  - your conscience is reset
3. It opens our understanding of God's Word
  - [Lk 7:29-30](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=luke+7:29-30)
  - it will be easy to follow God
