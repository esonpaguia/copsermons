## Offering

### Blessed in association
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mat 17:24-27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+17:24-27)

- [Mat 17:27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/17-27.html) - Jesus paid his tax and Peter's
- God pays kingdom debts, and your debts
- you are not alone on getting out of debt
- God wants to pay your debt
- God will help to pay my debt
- this is not a struggle that you have to walk alone
- this is a truth of hope, that we need to accept, understand and constantly reminded of

#### We are blessed in association
- we don't walk alone in this world, we are not self-made men
- things come into our lives because of our relationship with God and with other people
- we are blessed in association, in relationships


1. Potiphar was blessed in association with Joseph
  - [Gen 39:5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+39:21-23)
  - The world says if you want to prosper, you need to build relationships with rich people
  - Potiphar was rich, Joseph was a slave
  - when you hangout with rich people, you loose money
  - you are blessed in association with people who know God and whom God is blessing
  - money doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you truly are

2. The prison warden was blessed in association with Joseph
  - [Gen 39:21-23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+39:21-23)
  - The world says you are blessed by the association with the powerful
  - the blessings of association
    - won't come from what people have or what people have power with
    - comes from their relationship with God and God's hand upon their lives
  - you are not blessed hanging out with rich or powerful people

3. Laban was blessed in association with Jacob
  - [Gen 30:27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/30-27.html)

4. A man was blessed in association with Elisha
  - [2 Kings 6:1-7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-kings/passage/?q=2-kings+6:1-7)
  - to have an iron equipment, it is very expensive
  - blessed in association with a man of faith
  - we are blessed in association with relationships with men and women of God
  - you don't have to pay for that, but you have to desire for it


- [Mat 17:27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/17-27.html)
- Jesus didn't pay the tax for the other 11 disciples, just Peter
- because Peter was right there hanging out with Jesus
- there is no long distance relationship of association
- don't just hangout with Jesus during Sunday, but the rest of the week
- live with Jesus everyday

- don't wait for things to happen, you have to make decisions


## Teaching

### Decisions
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Acts 19:21-23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/passage/?q=acts+19:21-23)

#### Making decisions
- Paul decided to go to Jerusalem
- Paul came to a point that a decision needed to be made
- you cannot live in the glory of past successes and can't even continue to live on current successes
- some Christians live in the realm of indecisions, they know how to make a decisions
- they are waiting for something to do something, rather than initiate action by making a decision
- and because they don't make a decision and waiting for circumstances to do something, their lives begin to coast and slow down
- you fail to continue to make decisions

- We have to make decisions
  - Jesus made decisions
    - [John 1:43](http://www.biblestudytools.com/john/1-43.html)
  - Paul made decisions
    - [Acts 19:21](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/19-21.html) - to go Jerusalem
    - [Acts 20:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-3.html) - to avoid trouble
    - [Titus 3:12](http://www.biblestudytools.com/titus/3-12.html)
  - Apostles made decisions
    - [Acts 21:25](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/21-25.html) - about doctrines
  - Christians made decisions
    - [Acts 11:29](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/11-29.html) - about giving
    - [2 Cor 9:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/9-7.html)
  - Churches made decisions
    - [Acts 15:22](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/15-22.html)

- many Christians believed we must not make decisions, just wait for something to forces them to begin to do something and have no choice
- rather than living reacting, initiate action
- God wants you to use your brain and make a decision
- many are afraid to make a decision because
  - it is unspritual
  - it is the wrong one
    - we all make wrong decisions, we are all learning
    - use all you learned, and make better decision
    - if you made a bad one, make a better one

#### Decision is a spiritual thing
- [Acts 19:21](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/19-21.html) - left a word *"numa"* - Greek word for *"spirit"*
- making a decision is not a carnal worldly thing, it is a spiritual thing
- it is the work of the HS in our lives

#### Paul's goals
- Pauls' 1st goal was to go to Jerusalem thru Macedonia and Achea
- his 2nd was to visit Rome
  - he said he must go to Rome
  - *"dia"* - Greek word for obligatory, to be required

#### Implementing decisions
- the difference of making a decision and implementing a decision is a plan
- some people made decision, but do nothing

#### Making a plan
1. Focus on the goal, not the destination
  - you must define your real goal is
  - Paul: the destination was Jerusalem, goal was to bring healing between Jewish and Gentile churches
  - because of the goal, the goal affected the journey
  - what the goal is will determine how you will get there
  - the most efficient route to your destination is not always the most efficient route to your goal
  - the most time efficient route to your destination is not necessarily most effective way to achive your goal
  - the goal was organizing all the churches, getting the offering from all of these churches to be a blessing to the poor in Jerusalem and honor where the gospel begun.
  - [Gen 13:17-18](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+13:17-18) - God's all goal was to get the Israelites to the promise land, took them to an inefficient route
2. Focus on bringing people to the goal
  - [Gen 33:13-14](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+33:13-14) - Jacob understood to move slow to bring everybody alive
  - as you make decisions, you have to get people to the goal
  - Paul needed to get them ready
    - Paul knew it's no good going to Jerusalem and bring offerings, he needs to get all the Gentile churches involve in the goal
    - take time to do it right
  - Paul also knew there's trouble coming, so he stayed longer
  - some leaders want to do fast, but the goal is not the destination, the goal is to bring people to the goal
3. Keep the long term goal in view
  - never allow secondary goals overshadow the primary goals
  - Paul's primary goal was to go to Rome
  - [Acts 23:11](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/23-11.html), [Acts 27:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/27-23.html)
  - Paul didn't allow the trip to Jerusalem to overshadow his major goal that is to preach the gospel to Rome
  - keep your goals in balance
