## Offering

### Generosity of the heart
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mark 12:41-44](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/mark/passage/?q=mark+12:41-44)

- Jesus sat down and watched people bring their offerings
- every passover, the people were to bring an offering to the Lord. They are not to appear to God empty-handed
- the woman gave her offering out from poverty
- wealth doesn't impress Jesus
- Jesus was impressed with the generosity of the woman's heart
- the same measure you give, it will be given to you
- the measuring is not the zeroes, the measuring is the generosity
- it is the generosity that God blessed that got you where you are

## Teaching

### The Love of God
by Ptr. David Sumrall

- Jesus didn't walk and not know what will happen next
- He knew he would suffer, but he did it anyway
- He knew he will be betrayed, but he did it anyway
- it is unnatural to pursue pain
- He knew everything that was coming
- He never lost His joy
- [John 11:55-57](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/john/passage/?q=john+11:55-57) - He knew these people will reject Him at the end of the week

#### Knowing that he will be mistreated, suffered and be killed by the people
1. it didn't stop His love for them
2. it didn't stop His ministry
3. it didn't stop His relationship, faith, prayer for Peter

#### His love
- He laid His life for us
- knowing the future doesn't change the love of God
- knowing the future doesn't change the love for them
- God knew man will sin, but chose to love him and create man
- God knew Israel will reject Him, but chose them to be His chosen people
- the actions of man don't change the character of God
- [1 Joh 4:8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/1-john/4-8.html)
- there's nothing you can do to change His love, stop loving you because He chose you
- it is not license to sin, but a great reason to come back
- you don't earn His love

#### His ministry
- He came back (Monday), walked in the temple and cleansed it
- there should be no corruption in his Father's house
- they have 4 days to inspect the passover lamb
- Jesus is the passover lamb
- they are allowed to look at Him for 4 days
- What Jesus do that week?

- [Mat 26:69-75](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+26:69-75) - denial of relationship
- [Tit 1:15-16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/titus/passage/?q=titus+1:15-16) - we can deny relationship with actions
- he left and went back on fishing, Jesus went to Peter

- Peter faced the reality of his heart
- Peter faced his heart and return to the commitment he made
- faced your heart and return to the commitment you make
