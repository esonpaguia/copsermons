- Paul's final challenge

- These are the expectations to pastors

- [Ac 20:25-27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+20:25-27), [Ac 20:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-38.html) - Paul's last chance to see them
- At this time, Paul was declaring this to the elders of Ephesus
- [Ez 3:18-20](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=ezekiel+3:18-20)
- [Ez 33:1-8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=ezekiel+33:1-8)
- Pastors are watchmen
- Pastors are held accountable for the people by God
- Disuade people from sin
- Even it is not popular, or cause other people not to like them

#### Reminder of the function of true biblical leadership
- [Act 20:28](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-28.html)
  - First responsibility of the shepherds is to keep watch of themselves
    - As an individual
      - If leader falls into sin, it tears up other people's lives
      - [1 Ti 4:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-timothy/4-16.html) - watch/pay attention to your lifestyle and doctrine
      - watch your doctrine
        - study the Word of God, not copy someone's sermons
        - don't teach stupid
    - As a group (group of pastors)
      - watch over each other
  - pastors function as overseers
    - visiting and watching people
    - bishop is not a rank or title, it is a function
      - function to visit and watch people
    - take care of one flock
      - only the flock that the HS gave you
      - a pastor is only responsible of a group of people
      - shepherds of the church of God, not pastor's church
      - [1 Pe 5:4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/5-4.html) - God is the chief shepherds
      - [Ez 34:31](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/34-31.html) - we are God's sheep
      - pastors are technically assistant pastors
      - [Ps 78:70-72](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=psalm+78:70-72) - pastors serve with a compelling and transparent heart
      - continue to train and work in their skills
- [Ps 23:1-6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/23.html) 
  - lead the people to abundance
  - not to overwork the sheep. Make people rest
  - lead people to the HS
  - help people
  - every place a pastor leads/brings people must be a path of righteousness
