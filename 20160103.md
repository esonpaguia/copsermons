### What is real faith?
by Ptr. David Sumrall

- [Isa 32:18](http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/32-18.html) - God's will for our families
- a place that is secure and undisturbed
- this can be the year when your family moves to your dream home
- some families move to a disaster, not because they don't have faith, but imitated faith
- some people aren't really walking in faith. Instead they are walking with an imitated faith

#### So how can you recognize real faith from imitated faith?
1. Real faith hears from God
  - [Exo 14:21-28](http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/passage/?q=exodus+14:21-28) - Israelites' responded by obedience to the command of God
2. Real faith obeys God today
  - [Deu 1:6-8](http://www.biblestudytools.com/deuteronomy/passage/?q=deuteronomy+1:6-8)
  - Real faith understands that God keeps moving
  - you cannot obey what God told you yesterday, you have to obey what God is speaking to you today
  - sometimes our decisions cause/hinder to stray away from the goal
  - when we don't obey God immediately, we have to understand God keeps moving
  - what God's will for today may not what God's will for tomorrow
  - don't live the past to find your future
  - Ask God *"Where is my dream house today?"*, *"What are you speaking to me today?"*
  - real faith is not obeying what God said before, but what God is saying today
3. Real faith always seen by action
  - [Jam 2:17](http://www.biblestudytools.com/james/2-17.html)
  - a vision requires change in your lifestyle
  - you have put works in your faith
  - faith without work is dead
  - your works put life in that faith
