## Offering

### How to prosper
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Pr 16:27-30](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/passage/?q=proverbs+16:27-30)

#### People that you do not want in your life
- Scoundrel
  - Who digs up your past (failures, sin) and uses it to destroy your present
  - Jesus already washed you as white as snow
- Perversed man
  - Who deviates from what is right
  - Who purposely lie, twist the truth, tell half truths, don't lie but don't tell the whole story
  - [Pr 16:27-30 NASB](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nas/proverbs/passage/?q=proverbs+16:27-30) - Farmers of strife (violent confrontation, discussion)
  - They act innocent
  - They plant seed of bitter conflicts to our relationship to other people. Everybody will be arguing
  - You don't need to fight them, just ignore them
  - You need peacemakers and not strife-farmers
