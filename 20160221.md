## Offering

### What kind of person are you?
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Mat 14:22-34](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+14:22-34)

##### What kind of person are you?
1. Are you a person who waits on God to fix/solve your problem?
2. Are you a doer (a person of action)?


- Jesus constantly 
  - taught his disciples to be doers
  - challenges us  
- these 12 disciples
  - had the same promise to get to the other side
  - had the same problem or were in the same situation (storm)
  - had the same possibility. They all saw Jesus walking on the water
  - were all afraid ([Mat 14:26-27](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+14:26-27))
- 11 of them made one decision to wait in the boat until Jesus join them
  - wait Jesus to fix their problem
- 1 of them chose to be different
  - wanted to step out of the boat in faith
  - took advantage and did the possibility that he saw that was in front of him

##### What does it take to be a person of action?
1. See what Jesus is doing
  - [Mat 14:26](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/14-26.html)
  - everbody must see past their circumstances and learn to focus on the possibilities
  - look past your circumstances and see the possibilities
  - if all you gonna do is focus on your problems, you will never see what is possible
2. Face your fears 
  - face the fear of the unknown
    - willing to learn something new
    - anytime you learn, you are facing the fear of failure
    - part of the price of learning. The price of education is pain and financial expense of failing as you learn
    - you will fail a few times as you learn to do things you haven't done before
  - face the fear of humiliation of failing
    - we don't want to embarass ourselves in front of our family and friends
  - leave your safety zone
    - do things that you have not done before
3. Get started
  - the challenge of getting started begins with Jesus tell me to come to you
  - Peter asked for the command
  - the difference between real faith and imitated faith is you get a command from God
    - God commanded Moses to part the sea and cross thru it
      - faith is obedience to God [Heb 11](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/hebrews/11.html)
    - Pharaoh tried to imitate faith. He didn't have a command from God that was why his army died
  - Like saying *"Can I try?"*
    - after a while, children like to try what they saw their parents were doing
    - Jesus does what His father is doing
  - Peter saw Him walking, but he waited for the command
  - faith is an obedience from a command of God

##### Peter asked for the command
- doing things people haven't done before
- success is for volunteers
- you don't draft people on success
- water walkers are not chosen by God, they are volunteers
- people who do things that haven't done before, they are not drafted by God, it's not about faith
- they are people who see past their circumstances and begin to focus on the possibilities
- *God if you tell me to do that, I can do it*

##### Challenge of little faith
- when learning something, you fail a little bit
- [Mat 14:30-31](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+14:30-31)
- *"little faith"* here meant little in amount of time, short burst of faith
- after a short burst of faith, all of a sudden we get scared and begin to fail

##### What do you do when you start failing?
- when your faith runs out and begin to fail , humble yourself and ask God for help
- we all fail
- God doesn't condemn us for learning and trying
- immediately, God reached out and saved Peter


- Peter got back up and walked on water again with Jesus going to the boat
- [Mar 6:48](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/mark/6-48.html) - Jesus was about to pass them by to meet them on the other side, but he answered to the one who called
- the person with faith got Jesus' attention
- be a wet walker than a dry waiter
- Peter's faith brought blessings to others on the boat
- God is always looking for faith

## Teaching

### The Kingdom of God forcely advancing upon this Earth
by Ptr. Jamie Weidner

#### Context verse: [Mat 11:1-15](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+11:1-15)
- John the baptist's message is to repent for the kingdom of heaven is coming
- he was speaking boldly
- he broke the silence
- John's mark begun the church age
- he had simple, moral and good message but experienced pushback/opposition
- sometimes, doing the right thing creates problems/challenges
- the advancement of gospel will fulfill its purpose, and we just have to decide to ride the train
- [Mat 11:2-6](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+11:2-6) - gospel is a message of words and deeds
- not forcely advancing using weapons of war
- it's not our own methods, but the power of the HS will make you effective
- kingdom work is not for wimps
- [Mic 2:12-13](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/micah/passage/?q=micah+2:12-13) 
- [Mat 9:38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/nlt/matthew/9-38.html)
