### The Compelled Heart
by Ptr. David Sumrall

#### Context verse: [Ac 20:17-38](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=acts+20:17-38)

- Don't give up your goal when you see you can't keep up with your calendar, just continue to move on.
- Motives of real Christian are easy to understand but the convenient, carnal Christians are not easy. Our values and ethics are simple and same. 
- Motives of the real Christian are extrememly difficult to understand

#### Understanding the compelled heart
- [Ac 20:22](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-22.html) - A compelled heart is not a controlled heart, not a dominated heart
- A heart that is restricted to one goal 
- This goal started two years ago, from a decision to being compelled
- 2 things that make us compelled
  - the love of Christ
    - not our love for Him, but His love for us
    - [Ep 3:17-19](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=ephesians+3:17-19)
  - the Holy Spirit
- [Ac 20:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-23.html) - A compelled heart is not manipulated by ignorance
- So we can have informed decisions
- A compelled heart understands that there are times in our lives that God will ask us to do difficult and unpleasant things that will sacrifice/affect our lifestyle, pain, etc. Ask to do that are not enjoying or not easy. This is where only the committed will walk.

#### How a compelled heart can face the difficulty and hardship to reach the goal
- it is unnatural to pursue pain
- when God ask us to do something that is difficult and unpleasent, how can we face it?
1. A compelled heart fixes its eyes to Jesus

  - [He 12:1-3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=hebrews+12:1-3)
  - the pain will just be a short season
  - Jesus scorn pain and shame and knew there is joy at the end  
2. A compelled heart refuses to be ashamed from persecution
  - [2 Ti 1:12](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-timothy/1-12.html) - facing persecution takes a decision
3. A compelled heart delight on insults, persecution
  - [2 Co 12:10](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/12-10.html)
4. There are two promises
  - Nothing can separate me from the love of Christ
    - [Ro 8:35-39](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=romans+8:35-39)
    - this is the belief you hold on during all the persecution, insults
    - [2 Co 4:8-9](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=2+corinthians+4:8-9) - persecution will press you, but Christ will not abandon you
  - God will rescue you
