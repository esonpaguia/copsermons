- Paul warned the elders about the religious predators and they have to guard the church from them.

#### Religious predators from the outside
- [Ac 20:29](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-29.html)
- During the absence of strong leadership and in the transition of leadership.
- They come in and attack as a pack/group.
- They act free and wild, savage.
- They are strong-willed important people with a following.

  ##### How do they operate?
  - They are in pack.
  - They scatter the flock.
  - They are sheep, not leaders.
    - [Mt 7:1](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/7-1.html)
    - They don't come in as a leader or seek for leadership position.

  ##### How can you recognize them?
  - They have strong personalities.
  - They come as a group.
  - They are wild, cannot be tamed.
  
  ##### What shepherds must do?
  - [Ac 20:31](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-31.html) - They must be on guard.
  - They must lay down their lives for the sheep.
    - [Jn 10:11-13](http://www.biblestudytools.com/passage/?q=john+10:11-13)
  - They must not back out.
    - [Mt 10:16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/10-16.html)

    - Be shrewd and innocent with them.
    - [Ps 18:26](http://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/18-26.html)
    - Never outfight people but outthink them.
    - You cannot beat lies with lies, deceit with deceit, politics with politics, cruedness with cruedness, be innocent.
    - Keep your heart innocent, and let your brain outthink them.

#### Religious predators from the inside
- [Ac 20:30](http://www.biblestudytools.com/acts/20-30.html)
- During transition time, not everyone who rise up or stands up should stand up, not a godly leader.

  ##### 2 Types of people
  - Seeds of Satan
    - [Mt 13:25](http://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/13-25.html)

  - When leaders did something strong but it was the right thing to do, thank them.
