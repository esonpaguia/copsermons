- one of the challenges of some young men is the lack of father
- 75% of homes in Manila has no father

- God hardwired men to look for a wife, not the other way around
- wife brings you God's favor, not favor brings you a wife
- "findeth" - the Hebrew word means "to find by thinking"
- don't find a wife with your hormones, emotions & desires
- find a wife with thinking

##### Why do you have a desire for a wife?
- [Gen 2:18](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/2-18.html) - God desired companionship, fellowship, same goes to us
- God created us in his image
- [Pro 4:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/4-23.html) - when you are looking, you have to guard your heart
- your heart includes your emotions, desire, systems of logic

##### Why do you need to think?
- [Pro 31:30](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/31-30.html)
  - Charm is deceptive
  - Beauty is fleeting

##### What are you looking for a girl?
1. Life partner
  - you are looking a companion for life, partner in life, not a sex partner
  - [Mal 2:14](http://www.biblestudytools.com/malachi/2-14.html)
  - Qualifications of a wife:
    1. A woman
      - [Gen 2:22-24](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+2:22-24) - God didn't create another man
    2. A Christian
      - [2 Cor 6:14-16](http://www.biblestudytools.com/2-corinthians/passage/?q=2-corinthians+6:14-16) - you have nothing in common, no harmony, no agreement with an unbeliever
    3. Someone you enjoy being with
      - [Ecc 9:9](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.html)
      - this is not a business partnership, this is a life partner
      - you do not marry pain
      - marriage is not doing penance
      - can you enjoy life with this person based on your education, values, lifestyle?
    4. Someone you agree in life
      - [Amos 3:3](http://www.biblestudytools.com/amos/3-3.html)
      - you have to agree on things of the future
      - until two agree, no one can walk together
    5. Someone you respect
      - [1 Pet 3:7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/1-peter/3-7.html) - willing to respect her
      - [Eph 5:21](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/5-21.html) - willing to listen her

  - [Pro 12:4](http://www.biblestudytools.com/proverbs/12-4.html) - she must have a noble character
  - [Gen 2:18](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/2-18.html) - she must be a helper suitable for you
  
#### How to begin the pursuit
1. Sit down with your parents
  - they know you
  - ask them what kind of a girl good for you
  - [Gen 28:6-7](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/passage/?q=genesis+28:6-7) - don't be like Esau who chose a wife to make his parents mad
  - your father will be more helpful with this than your mother
  - because mother thinks no girl is good enough for his son as like a father thinks no boy is good enough for his daughter
  - don't marry a person your parents hate
2. Begin to look logicly, not lustfully
  - that takes you to grow enough to know yourself
  - you don't know what you want until you know who you are
  - finish growing up, know who you are
  - go out in groups
3. Understand the purpose of courtship
  - that doesn't mean you have to get married, you are exploring the possibility
  - courting is not caught, it is exploring
  
#### Rules of courting
- A man live by rules, you respect other men


1. Respect her father
  - obey what her father says
  - she is under his authority
  - respect the authority on her life
  - respect her brothers
  - it is not a competition to pull her away from her family
2. Start slow
  - Get to know her at her home
  - so she feels safe and her family feels safe
  - go to the family and get them to see you more
  - don't take her away from her family
  - parents are protective on their daughters
  - you need to display the fact that you can take care of her
  - you should have your own money, a plan
  - the father wants to see will this boy sacrifice for his daughter
  - willing to give gifts for her, for her family
  - help around
  - show them you have good intentions
  - don't show attitude, show respect
